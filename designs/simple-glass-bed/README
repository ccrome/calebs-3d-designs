This is a design for a simplified glass bed for the 2014 Type A Series 1 printer.

The benefit is you can do-away with the aluminum glass carrier all together.

Instructions:
   1) Print 2x of bed-holder-pair.stl. (Note: there are actually 2 types, a front and a back version.)
   2) Get yourself a piece of 12" x 15" x 1/4" safety glass. 
   3) superglue or epoxy the bed holders in place.  Do this by first attaching the bed holders to your typeA machine, then glue the glass onto the bed holders.  Or this is my plan anyway...
