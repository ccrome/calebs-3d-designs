This is a place for me to keep patches to Cura.  

Currently, the only patch is for the gcode viewer inside cura to draw only the top layer, instead of all layers.  The all layer view mode is neat, but I prefer to just see one layer at a time.

To install, simply cd to your cura directory, checkout the 'patches' directory, then quilt push -a.
