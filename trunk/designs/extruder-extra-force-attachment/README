There are 2 designs in this directory, targeted for the 2014 Type A Machines extruder.

The base design adds extra force to the extruder spring because the original spring was too weak.  It uses a clicky-ball-point-pen spring as the extra force.  

The other design is an extruder replacement jig to assist in extruder assembly/disassembly.
