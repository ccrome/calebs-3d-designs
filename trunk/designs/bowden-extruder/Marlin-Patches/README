This is a set of patches to apply to the marlin source code. 

To use: 

# cd <Arduino Sketch Directory>
# svn co https://github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin/trunk/Marlin
# cd Marlin
# svn co https://caleb-typea-settings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/designs/bowden-extruder/Marlin-Patches/patches
# quilt push -a

Alternatively, you can look in the patches directory and apply each patch from the 'series' file manually.  It's easy since there isn't much to change.

Then open up the arduino software, choose board = Mega, & port.  Then compile and upload.   For some reason, the Rumba only works on my macbooks rearward USB port .  Don't know why.

Importantly, the current firmware version I have checked in here uses 1/8 stepping on the X axis -- you probably want to put it back to 160 steps per unit like the Y.
